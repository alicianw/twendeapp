        <h4>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h4>
        <p>We noticed that individuals find it hard to travel to new destinations without company. Sometimes, the
          people they would want to tag along with them are committed and thus unavailable. We make it our
          responsibility to make group-traveling possible for such individuals!</p>
